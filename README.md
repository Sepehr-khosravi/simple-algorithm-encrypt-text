# Simple Text to Number Encryptor

This is a simple Python script that encrypts a text message by converting each letter to a unique number based on a predefined mapping.

## 🔐 How It Works

- Each lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z' is mapped to a number starting from 222 up to 247.
- The script takes user input, converts it to lowercase, and replaces each letter with its corresponding number.
- The final encrypted message is printed as a string of numbers.

For example:
Input: Hello
Encrypted Output: 228226237237241
